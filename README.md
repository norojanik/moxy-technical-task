# Moxymind-technical-task
This project is a simple test automation framework designed for mobile application testing. It uses **Appium** and **WebdriverIO** with **JavaScript** for automating tests.

## Design Patterns Used

### Page Object Model (POM): <br>
Separates test scripts from the page-specific actions, promoting reusability and maintainability.

## Emulator/Simulator Setup <br>
iOS Simulator: Use Xcode to set up and start an iOS simulator.


## Run all tests:

start appium server <br>
`appium -p 4724` <br> 
run the script <br>
`npm run wdio`
